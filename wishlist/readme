READ ME


This app aims to organize and log everything someone might want for christmas, forgoeing the need to remember it, or use ancient technology such as pencil and paper.  
You can create new wishes, or edit currently existing ones, all while knowing they are saved regardless if you open and close the app.

An obstacle I had with this project was loading the Data from the saved file, but Riley helped me fix this in class.
I wish I had more time to implement more features from my feature list, to really make this project shine, but deadlines are deadlines.


Original Feature List:

A User can create a wishlist item so that they can keep track of what they want for Christmas.
A User can view a list of their created items so that they can see an overview of everything they want.
A user can edit and/or remove items from a list so they can match the list to their updated wishes.
A user can set prices for wishlist items so they can manage their expenditure.
A user can order the items from most wanted to least wanted so they can track the value of the items to them.
A user can add links to items so they have easy access to purchase an item from the app
A user can sort by most to least expensive or vice versa, so they can see the prices they are willing to purchase.
A user can set a price range so they can view items within their price range
